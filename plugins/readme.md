Plugins in BigNothing
=====================

In the folder `/plugins` of the BigNothing root folder we can deploy plugins for the framework. Remind that the BigNothing protocol itself also has plugins or add-ons. But those are a different kind of plugins entirely based on javascript. The plugins in the plugins-folder are all php-based plugins for the framework. These plugins are nothing more or less than usual modules like in the folder `/modules`. See there for further details on how to create your own modules/plugins.
